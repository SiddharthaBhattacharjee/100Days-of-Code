# 100Days-of-Code
I am taking up the #100DaysOfCodeChallenge from Jan 1st 2022. Under this challenge , I have to code for atleast an hour every day for 100 days.
Here are the [Rules](https://github.com/SiddharthaBhattacharjee/100Days-of-Code/blob/main/Rules.md) which I will be following for the challenge.<br>
I will be maintaining a [Log](https://github.com/SiddharthaBhattacharjee/100Days-of-Code/blob/main/logs.md) in this repo, so that anyone can track my progress. All my work will be linked in Log.<br>

My main motivation behind taking up the #100DaysOfCodingChallenge is to increase my consistency. As it is famously said "Consistency is the key to success." I goal is to learn to work hard consistantly from this challenge.
I will give my beft efforts to complete the challenge without any breaks. I would also try to code more than the minimum time of one hour for most of the days.
In case I absolutely have to take a break longer than a day in regards of Sem Exam , Sickness of any other valid reason , I will add 2 extra days to the challenge for each day I've missed.
Fell free to give any sugestions you have for me. All suggestions are welcome.
