## <u>Day 13 ; Jan 13th 2022 **Thursday** : </u>
Today I learned about how to store data using shared preferences in android✍️<br>
I completed my contacts app (for now, more features might be added in future). Now It can store contacts, make calls, sms, and emails. I have completed the database connectivity of the app. And I have submitted it as my MLH LHD Week long project. It has been a fun as well as a challenging project to work on.😄 Also to be transparent, I have dropped the profile picture feature, I will add it back when I have more knowledge on bitmap, for now, It is too complicated for a beginner like me and I think I should take it in step by step rather than bighting off more than I can chew😅<br>
Other than that, I have continued working on my personal project i.e. The app for my friends birthday. I have updated the app to add data storage feature so that the progress we made in solving challenges isn't lost upon closing the app. Also fixed some minor issues from the last commit of the app.💻<br>
Today, I worked for <b>4 hours</b> out of which, 30 minutes went towards learning about shared preferences , 2 hrs went towards working on my contacts app and remaining 1.5 hrs went towards working on the birthday present app.🕐<br>

## <u>Day 14 ; Jan 14th 2022 **Friday** : </u>
Today I worked on a very useless and inefficient HelloWorld code, as one of today's MLH Local hack Day7 challenges was to create a useless invention hack. Hello, World is already a bit useless program whose only use is being the first line of code of most of the programmers, so I made it significantly worse. It prints hello world in a very inefficient way. It has a list of all characters out of which it chooses randomly and matches with another list which has the hello world characters one by one, then prints each stage of the process, the cherry on top, it does it 1000 times(prints only once) and finds the average no. of turns it takes to print hello world using this method. I don't know if anyone needs to know this information, It's Useless. Wait, there is more, it also instead of adding the turns on a variable and deciding by 1000, it writes each value of the number of turns in a text file and then reads it back while calculating the average.😶<br>
Other than that I continued working on my personal project i.e. The app for my friends birthday. I added 3 more levels today which included implementing the classic guess the number game with a twist, if you can't guess within 5 turns, you will have to restart, and I made sure to not make it terminal based like we have been making for years and have a decent UI💻<br> Today was a fun day, I really enjoyed working on the useless app , it was a fun challenge to take on, other than that, I am really enjoying the entire process of working on the birthday app, This project is mostly completed, it might 2 more days and then it will be finished😄<br>
Today I worked for <b>5hrs</b> out of which 1 hour went toward coding the MLH project and the remaining 4 hrs went towards working on the birthday app. 🕐<br>

## <u>Day 15 ; Jan 15th 2022 **Saturday** : </u>
Today, I created a mockup app for the MLH LHD Day7 Challenge, I decided not to post it on GitHub as it is a mockup and has only the layout part to it. The challenge required me to submit a screenshot so I did not create a Repo for it.✍️<br>
Other than That I spent most of my time today working on the birthday app, as tomorrow is the last day to work on it and we will be presenting it to the Birthday boy tomorrow at midnigt 12 o'clock. So, I am trying to wrap things up as fast as I can on this app. Today I fixed some issues found by my friends while testing the app, other than that I created 2 more levels, one of which included implementing the Hand Wrestling game, which was farely complicated and took some time to get figured out, I created a flowchart to figure out the flow of processes before jumping into the code for this one. This app will be finished by tomorrow and I will continue to learn new topics.💻<br>
Today I worked for <b>4 hours</b> out of which 1 hour went towards working on the app mockup and remaining 3 hours went towards working on the birthday app.🕐<br>
