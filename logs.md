# **100 Days of Code - Log**
## <u>Day 0 ; Dec 31st 2021 **Friday** : </u>
Today I am taking up the #100DaysOfCodeChallenge and From tomorrow I will be coding daily for atleast an hours. 📢 <br>
Today I have prepared the repo to log my progress, set up the rules I will be following, and I have made a public statement of my challenge. ✍️ <br>
I will be making my progress public to keep myself motivated to keep going. I will give my very best to complete the challenge without any obstacles. Even though the rule states only 1 Hour of code daily to be necessary for the challenge, but I will try to give atleast 2-3 hrs most of the days. 😄<br>

Today I learned about different layouts in Android which included Constraint Layout, Linear Layout, Relative Layout, and Table Layout.📖 <br>
Then I started working on an app in which I applied what I was taught today to create an app similar to link-tree. I used constraint layout, linear vertical layout, and Table layout. While coding the app, I also learned how to create image buttons and how to use card view to display a circular image. 💻<br>
Today I worked for a total of 2 hrs 30 mins. Out of which 1hr went towards learning and 1hr 30mins went toward coding the app.🕐 <br>
