# **100 Days of Code - Log**
## <u>Day 0 ; Dec 31st 2021 **Friday** : </u>
Today I am taking up the #100DaysOfCodeChallenge and From tomorrow I will be coding daily for atleast an hours. 📢 <br>
Today I have prepared the repo to log my progress, set up the rules I will be following, and I have made a public statement of my challenge. ✍️ <br>
I will be making my progress public to keep myself motivated to keep going. I will give my very best to complete the challenge without any obstacles. Even though the rule states only 1 Hour of code daily to be necessary for the challenge, but I will try to give atleast 2-3 hrs most of the days. 😄<br>

## <u>Day 1 ; Jan 1st 2022 **Saturday** : </u>
Today I learned about different layouts in Android which included Constraint Layout, Linear Layout, Relative Layout, and Table Layout.📖 <br>
Then I started working on an app in which I applied what I was taught today to create an app similar to link-tree. I used constraint layout, linear vertical layout, and Table layout. While coding the app, I also learned how to create image buttons and how to use card view to display a circular image. 💻<br>
Today I worked for a total of around <b>2 hrs 30 mins</b>. Out of which 1hr went towards learning and 1hr 30mins went toward coding the app.🕐 <br>

## <u>Day 2 ; Jan 2nd 2022 **Sunday** : </u>
Today I learned about Scroll Views and their uses and implementation in Android Development. As well as how they can be nested and how linear layouts are used in scroll view.📖<br>
After that I started working on an app in which I applied what I learned to create a Git CheatSheet Android app which uses nested scroll views(hprizontal and vertical) and linear layouts. While coding the app I also learned about divider view and used it in my app.💻<br>
Today I worked for a total of around <b>2 hrs</b>. Out of which 40 mins went towards learning and 1 hr 20 min towards coding the app.🕐<br>

## <u>Day 3 ; Jan 3rd 2022 **Monday** : </u>
Today has been a big day for my app development learning journey as I learned many new concepts. Today I learned about how to create multi screen apps , which included the concepts of BackStack, Intents , difference between Explicit and Implicit Intents, different types of Implicit Intents, and Sending data cross activity using Intents.📖<br>
Then I resumed my work on the MySocial app as I have now gained the necesarry topics to continue the project. I created a 2nd activity to open all my social medias using the concepts I learned today, on top of that, while coding I got to learn about WebView in Android as well as Email Intent. I implemented webView on a separate activity which opens the social media websties based on which one the user clicks , and Email Intent is used to make it easier for the user to access the host's email from the app. While working on adding all the new features , I also put all the previous layout in a scroll view to make it more accessable for smaller devices.💻<br>
Today I have worked for more than 6 Hours out of which around 2 hours went towards learning the new topics and the remaining 4hrs went towards working on the app.🕐
// I've really been hooked on coding today. 😁<br>
