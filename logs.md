# **100 Days of Code - Log**
## <u>Day 0 ; Dec 31st 2021 **Friday** : </u>
Today I am taking up the #100DaysOfCodeChallenge and From tomorrow I will be coding daily for atleast an hours. 📢 <br>
Today I have prepared the repo to log my progress, set up the rules I will be following, and I have made a public statement of my challenge. ✍️ <br>
I will be making my progress public to keep myself motivated to keep going. I will give my very best to complete the challenge without any obstacles. Even though the rule states only 1 Hour of code daily to be necessary for the challenge, but I will try to give atleast 2-3 hrs most of the days. 😄<br>

## <u>Day 1 ; Jan 1st 2022 **Saturday** : </u>
Today I learned about different layouts in Android which included Constraint Layout, Linear Layout, Relative Layout, and Table Layout.📖 <br>
Then I started working on an app in which I applied what I was taught today to create an app similar to link-tree. I used constraint layout, linear vertical layout, and Table layout. While coding the app, I also learned how to create image buttons and how to use card view to display a circular image. 💻<br>
Today I worked for a total of around <b>2 hrs 30 mins</b>. Out of which 1hr went towards learning and 1hr 30mins went toward coding the app.🕐 <br>

## <u>Day 2 ; Jan 2nd 2022 **Sunday** : </u>
Today I learned about Scroll Views and their uses and implementation in Android Development. As well as how they can be nested and how linear layouts are used in scroll view.📖<br>
After that I started working on an app in which I applied what I learned to create a Git CheatSheet Android app which uses nested scroll views(hprizontal and vertical) and linear layouts. While coding the app I also learned about divider view and used it in my app.💻<br>
Today I worked for a total of around <b>2 hrs</b>. Out of which 40 mins went towards learning and 1 hr 20 min towards coding the app.🕐<br>

## <u>Day 3 ; Jan 3rd 2022 **Monday** : </u>
Today has been a big day for my app development learning journey as I learned many new concepts. Today I learned about how to create multi screen apps , which included the concepts of BackStack, Intents , difference between Explicit and Implicit Intents, different types of Implicit Intents, and Sending data cross activity using Intents.📖<br>
Then I resumed my work on the MySocial app as I have now gained the necesarry topics to continue the project. I created a 2nd activity to open all my social medias using the concepts I learned today, on top of that, while coding I got to learn about WebView in Android as well as Email Intent. I implemented webView on a separate activity which opens the social media websties based on which one the user clicks , and Email Intent is used to make it easier for the user to access the host's email from the app. While working on adding all the new features , I also put all the previous layout in a scroll view to make it more accessable for smaller devices.💻<br>
Today I have worked for more than <b>6 Hours</b> out of which around 2 hours went towards learning the new topics and the remaining 4hrs went towards working on the app.🕐
// I've really been hooked on coding today. 😁<br>

## <u>Day 12 ; Jan 12th 2022 **Wednesday** : </u>
Today, I made a Flappy Bird game in python for MLH Local Hack Day-3 , the challenge was to make a one button game. And what better one button game to make then the classic Flappy Bird. It is a very simple and easy to make yet very fun to play game.😄<br>
Other than That, I continued my work on my personal project , the android app for my friends birthday. Today I completed two more levels , one of which has a puzzle as the game and the other has Hand Cricket as its game. I got to implement the classic Hand Cricket game we used to play as kids on an Android app , It has been really fun to work on this project so far, I am really enjoying the new challenges I am facing every day as well as implementing all the games from our childhood is a trip down memory lane.😌<br>
Today, I worked for <b>5 hrs and 30 mins</b> out of which 2 hrs went toward coding flappy bird game and the remaining 3 hrs 30 mins toward coding the android app.🕐<br>

## <u>Day 13 ; Jan 13th 2022 **Thursday** : </u>
Today I learned about how to store data using shared preferences in android✍️<br>
I completed my contacts app (for now, more features might be added in future). Now It can store contacts, make calls, sms, and emails. I have completed the database connectivity of the app. And I have submitted it as my MLH LHD Week long project. It has been a fun as well as a challenging project to work on.😄 Also to be transparent, I have dropped the profile picture feature, I will add it back when I have more knowledge on bitmap, for now, It is too complicated for a beginner like me and I think I should take it in step by step rather than bighting off more than I can chew😅<br>
Other than that, I have continued working on my personal project i.e. The app for my friends birthday. I have updated the app to add data storage feature so that the progress we made in solving challenges isn't lost upon closing the app. Also fixed some minor issues from the last commit of the app.💻<br>
Today, I worked for <b>4 hours</b> out of which, 30 minutes went towards learning about shared preferences , 2 hrs went towards working on my contacts app and remaining 1.5 hrs went towards working on the birthday present app.🕐<br>

## <u>Day 14 ; Jan 14th 2022 **Friday** : </u>
Today I worked on a very useless and inefficient helloworld code, as one of today's MLH Local hack Day7 challenge was to create a useless invention hack. Hello World is already a bit useless program whose only use is being the first line of code of most of the programmers, so I made it significantly worse. It prints hello world in a very unefficient way. It has a list of all characters out of which it chooses randomly and matches with another list which has the hello world characters one by one, then prints each stage of the process, the cherry on top, it does it 1000 times(prints only once) and finds the average no. of turns it takes to print hello world using this method. I don't know if anyone needs to know this information, It's Useless. Wait, there is more, it also instead of adding the turns on a variable and deciding by 1000, it writes each value of the number of turns in a text file and then reads it back while calculating the average.😶<br>
Other than that I continued working on my personal project i.e. The app for my friends birthday. I added 3 more levels today which included implementing the classic guess the number game with a twist, if you can't guess within 5 turns, you will have to restart, and I made sure to not make it terminal based like we have been making for years and have a decent UI💻<br> Today was a fun day, I really enjoyed working on the useless app , it was a fun challenge to take on, other than that, I am really enjoying the entire process of working on the birthday app , This project is mostly completed , it might 2 more days and then it will be finished😄<br>
Today I worked for <b>5hrs</b> out of which 1 hour went toward coding the MLH project and remaining 4 hrs went towards working on the birthday app. 🕐<br>
