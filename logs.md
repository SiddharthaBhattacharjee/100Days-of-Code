Today I learned about Scroll Views and their uses and implementation in Android Development. As well as how they can be nested and how linear layouts are used in scroll view.📖<br>
After that I started working on an app in which I applied what I learned to create a Git CheatSheet Android app which uses nested scroll views(hprizontal and vertical) and linear layouts. While coding the app I also learned about divider view and used it in my app.💻<br>
Today I worked for a total of around <b>2 hrs</b>. Out of which 40 mins went towards learning and 1 hr 20 min towards coding the app.🕐<br>

## <u>Day 3 ; Jan 3rd 2022 **Monday** : </u>
Today has been a big day for my app development learning journey as I learned many new concepts. Today I learned about how to create multi screen apps , which included the concepts of BackStack, Intents , difference between Explicit and Implicit Intents, different types of Implicit Intents, and Sending data cross activity using Intents.📖<br>
Then I resumed my work on the MySocial app as I have now gained the necesarry topics to continue the project. I created a 2nd activity to open all my social medias using the concepts I learned today, on top of that, while coding I got to learn about WebView in Android as well as Email Intent. I implemented webView on a separate activity which opens the social media websties based on which one the user clicks , and Email Intent is used to make it easier for the user to access the host's email from the app. While working on adding all the new features , I also put all the previous layout in a scroll view to make it more accessable for smaller devices.💻<br>
Today I have worked for more than <b>6 Hours</b> out of which around 2 hours went towards learning the new topics and the remaining 4hrs went towards working on the app.🕐
// I've really been hooked on coding today. 😁<br>
