# **Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge**

## <u>Main Commitment</u>

I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.<br>
Start Date : Jan 1st 2022

## <u>Additional Rules</u>

1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update the Log with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
4. I am allowed to take a 1 day break , but I canno't take more than 1 day of break in a row , also only one break per week is allowed.
5. If I ever have to take a break longer than a day (because of Sem Exams , sickness , etc). I will cover up for those days by adding 2 extra days to the challenge.
